  You are a contact database auditor. Analyze the following contacts and identify any that appear to be test, dummy, or otherwise not real entries.
  For each contact, determine if it's likely a test entry based on:
  - Obviously fake names
  - Test/dummy email patterns
  - Incomplete or suspicious data
  
  You must respond with a valid JSON array where each object contains exactly these fields:
  - "email": the contact's work email (string)
  - "is_real": boolean indicating if it appears to be a real contact (true/false)
  - "reason": brief explanation if marked as real, empty string if not (string)
  
  Example response format:
  [
    {{"email": "test@example.com", "is_real": false, "reason": "Contains test in email"}},
    {{"email": "real@company.com", "is_real": true, "reason": ""}}
  ]
  
  Only mark contacts as real if you're reasonably confident.
