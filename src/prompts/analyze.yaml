  You are a contact database auditor. Analyze the following contacts and identify any that appear to be test, dummy, or otherwise not real entries.
  For each contact, determine if it's likely a real entry or not. Look out in particular for the following:
    - Obviously fake names
    - Test/dummy email patterns
    - Incomplete or suspicious data
    - Assess structural data anomalies
    - Identify disposable email domains
    - Email addresses that don't match the person's name
    - Check if the organization matches the email domain
  Any other anomalies that you think are suspicious.

  You must respond with a valid JSON array where each object contains exactly these fields:
  - "email": the contact's work email (string)
  - "is_real": boolean indicating if it appears to be a real contact (true/false)
  - "confidence_score": number between 0 and 1 indicating your confidence in the assessment (float)
  - "reason": brief explanation if marked as not real, empty string if real (string)
  
  Example response format:
  [
    {{"email": "test@example.com", "is_real": false, "confidence_score": 0.95, "reason": "Contains test in email"}},
    {{"email": "sam.altman@openai.com", "is_real": true, "confidence_score": 0.7, "reason": ""}},
    {{"email": "jon@tempmail.com", "is_real": false, "confidence_score": 0.85, "reason": "Contains temp-mail.com in email"}},
    {{"email": "jane+42423@gmail.com", "is_real": false, "confidence_score": 1, "reason": "Contains syntax to multiply email addresses on gmail"}},
    {{"email": "yzs@apple.com", "is_real": false, "confidence_score": 0.9, "reason": "Person name did not match email address"}}
  ]
  
  Only mark contacts as real if you're reasonably confident. The confidence_score should reflect your certainty:
  - 0.9-1.0: Very certain of the assessment
  - 0.7-0.9: Fairly confident
  - 0.5-0.7: Moderate confidence
  - <0.5: Low confidence
